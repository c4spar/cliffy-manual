# Get started with Cliffy

Cliffy includes several modules which helps you to create interactive command
line tools. The main modules are the [command](./command/index.md) module which
lets you easily create complex command line interfaces and the
[prompt](./prompt/index.md) module which provides beautiful and feature rich cli
prompts.

Cliffy is published to [deno.land](https://deno.land/x/cliffy/) and the source
code is available on [Github](https://github.com/c4spar/deno-cliffy/).

> Since
> [v1.0.0-rc.4](https://github.com/c4spar/deno-cliffy/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.4)
> cliffy is also published on [jsr.io](https://jsr.io/@cliffy). As soon as
> jsr.io becomes stable, cliffy will probably only be published on jsr.io and no
> longer on deno.land.
